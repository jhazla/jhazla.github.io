I am a researcher working in different areas touching discrete mathematics and theoretical
computer science. I am a German Research Chair at [AIMS Rwanda](https://aims.ac.rw) in Kigali, funded by the
[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/).

My group also benefits from the cooperative project in partnership with Ludger Overbeck at the [Justus Liebig University Giessen](https://www.uni-giessen.de/en/index).
The project is supported by [DAAD](https://www.daad.de/en/).
