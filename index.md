I am a researcher working in different areas touching discrete mathematics and theoretical
computer science. I am a German Research Chair at [AIMS Rwanda](https://aims.ac.rw) in Kigali, funded by the
[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/).

My group also benefits from the cooperative project "Probability, Computing and Spin Glasses" in partnership with Nicola Kistler at [Goethe University](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/).
The project is supported by [DAAD](https://www.daad.de/en/).

## Summer school August 2024
From August 12 to August 23, 2024, we are organizing in Kigali the Summer Schoool A-PIC 24: **Probability, Information, Combinatorics** (in **Africa**). See the
