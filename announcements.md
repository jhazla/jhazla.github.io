At the moment I am operating a small group in Kigali with some postdocs and PhD students. I am always looking for opportunities for collaboration in areas which are (broadly) related to my research interests.

Do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested in joint research and/or a visit in Kigali.  

If you are a postdoc or experienced researcher who is German or works in Germany, you
can apply for the
[Feodor Lynen Research Fellowship](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/apply/sponsorship-programmes/feodor-lynen-research-fellowship) to stay and work with me in Kigali for 6 to 24 months. If you are interested, please contact
me by email.
