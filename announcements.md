At the moment I am operating a small group in Kigali with some postdocs and PhD students. I am always looking for opportunities for collaboration in areas which are (broadly) related to my research interests.

Do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested in joint research and/or a visit in Kigali.  

## Position calls

At the moment there are two open calls for DAAD postdoc positions with the deadline of April 7, 2023. See below for details:
* [Postdoc in algebra and learning theory.](files/postdoc_call_algebra.pdf)
