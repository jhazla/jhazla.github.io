At the moment I am operating a small group in Kigali with some postdocs and PhD students. I am always looking for opportunities for collaboration in areas which are (broadly) related to my research interests.

Do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested in joint research and/or a visit in Kigali.

From August 12 to August 23, 2024, we are organising in Kigali the Summer Schoool A-PIC 24: **Probability, Information, Combinatorics**) (in **Africa**). See the
