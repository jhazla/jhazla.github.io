## Recruitment

I am recruiting **two PhD students** and a **postdoc** in my research areas, that is **discrete mathematics and probability with applied motivations**. The application deadline is
**May 15, 2022**. The research topics will be mathematical, motivated by various applications like error-correction in data transmission, voting procedures, network processes and understanding machine learning algorithms.

We are looking for motivated candidates of all backgrounds (including **students and alumni of AIMS**) with a strong interest in those topics. The positions are based at **AIMS Rwanda** in Kigali, with a positive research environment and good quality of life. They are funded by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), and there will be a possibility of cooperation and visits at the Goethe University in Frankfurt.

> UPDATE: the instructions in the calls for sending reference letters have been updated.

> If you are not sure, I recommend you read the first sections in this
[book](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/papers/Analysis-of-Boolean-Functions-by-Ryan-ODonnell.pdf) to decide if you are motivated to work in this kind of mathematics.


## Workshop in Kigali

On **4-9 July 2022**, we will be organizing a **Discrete Mathematics Workshop** at **AIMS Rwanda in Kigali**. The application deadline is **May 15, 2022**. Applicants for PhD and postdoc are encouraged to apply.

The workshop is meant for young researchers, including **AIMS students and alumni**. The participants will be selected from the applications submitted.
The participants will be invited
to present their research (eg., results of their thesis) in short talks and to participate
in the scientific program of the workshop. The costs of flights and accommodation can
be covered thanks to the generous support of DAAD.
