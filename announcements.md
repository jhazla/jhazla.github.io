## Recruitment

In 2022 I will be recruiting **two PhD students** and a **postdoc** in my research areas, that is **discrete mathematics and probability** oriented towards **theoretical computer science**. I am looking for motivated candidates of all backgrounds (including **students and alumni of AIMS**) with a strong interest in those topics. The positions are based at **AIMS Rwanda** in Kigali, with a positive research environment and good quality of life. They are funded by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), and there will be a possibility of cooperation and visits at the Goethe University in Frankfurt.


> **More details and instructions on how to apply coming soon.**


## Workshop in Kigali

Around **July 2022**, I will be organizing a **Discrete Mathematics Workshop** at **AIMS Rwanda in Kigali**.
The workshop is meant for **AIMS students and alumni**. The participants will be selected
from the applications submitted.
The participants will be invited
to present their research (eg, results of their thesis) in short talks and to participate
in the scientific program of the workshop. The costs of flights and accommodation can
be covered thanks to the generous support of DAAD.
